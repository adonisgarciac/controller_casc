All the contributions are very welcome!

We are following the [GitHub Flow Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow). As a resume to the steps to be taken, here is a list of them:

1. Fork the main repository and clone to your local working area
1. Create a branch
1. Make changes
1. Create a pull request
1. Address review comments
1. Merge your pull request
1. Delete your branch
1. optionally you can delete your fork, too

As we are using the free tier of GitHub, it's a good idea to run the `ansible-lint` and `yaml-lint` commands locally before creating any pull request or push the commits to your remote (triggering the PR automatisms).
